## 0408 first meeting 

1. Briefly introduce your topic: indicative area, title, datasets, and possible methods.
2. Expectations: what you can expect from me, and what I expect from you.
3. What are your ‘take aways’ from the dissertation: future employment skills? exploration? developing a PhD topic?
4. Top tips for managing your dissertation.
5. Ethics – please take a few minutes to reflect on whether your project is likely to need approval.

Explore the effects of neighbourhood environment on residential value in the semantic space of the city.

## 1

1. Firstly, using a word-embedding technique, embedding representation of neighborhood environment is learned from neighborships on geographic space. 
2. Secondly, using a dimension-reduction technique (i.e., t-SNE), all embeddings are mapped onto 2-dimensional semantic space, where related or similar types would be nearer to each other, and semantic relations can be observed in this space. 
3. Thirdly, with the semantic space serving as a “base map,” the neighborhood environment of each residence is calculated, which can help intuitively understand and conveniently compare urban regions. 
4. Finally, the external effects of neighborhood environment on residential value will be explored based on a hedonic model.

I will mainly use house price data and poi data from China and London

According to some of my experimental results at this stage, my idea may not be very feasible, the main difficulty is how to generate meaningful poi sequence to be used as the training set, but I have some new ideas, such as understanding cities as networks and then using network embedding.

## 2

I want to be a good researcher in this field, and I am keep reading articles that are not limited to this field. Sometimes I am not sure if I am on the right track. I can do some presentation about my readings and my thoughts, and I would like my teacher to discuss with me and give me some feedback.  every two weeks 

For example, recently I read some articles about spatial graph convolutional networks I think are good for some work, also I am confused how to explain machine learning algorithms in my paper besides accuracy. I hope we can discuss these issues.

## 3

1. use learning method to seek to solve major scientific problems in the interaction of human and earth environment systems
2. have the ability to complete a full journal article in English. 
3. I hope to explore the possibility of  enhance our sensing capabilities for geographic phenomena through research and development of spatial intelligence, 

## 5

I will mainly use house price data and poi data from London.

All the data used in my dissertation are available from anonymous records and datasets that exist in the public domain, so I don't need an ethical review for my research.
